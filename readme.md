# Awesome

My own curated (meaning subjective) list of awesome things (relating to
computer science). I have (tried to) include examples and screenshots of
everything. [Unlicensed](license.md) for maximum fork enjoyment. 

*Please send in
pull requests if I missed anything obvious!*

This is kind of supposed to be a replacement for my browser bookmarks.
I thought it would be better to put these links out here for everyone,
than to have them rot in my previous convoluted folder hierachies.

how to access it (SSH access).

#### We Chall: [`wechall.net`](https://www.wechall.net)

Aggregates resources and links to challenges. Probably more extensive than
my list, and also includes some rather obscure ones. Worth checking out.

## Commercial

There are also some commecial challenges. These websites might offer paid
subscriptions or they might be sponsored by companies and used as recruitment
tools. They still have interesting problems — but some people use these as a
means to get hired instead of out of the pure pleasure of solving a
(complicated) problem.

## Fun

There are also some challenges that are a little more game-like. Some of these
might be good for beginners, while others might be good because you can watch
your code running, live.

# Design

Programming and Design is inseparably linked — whenever you write code, you design.
That could be the design of the framework, the design of the API, or the
design of the UI. These are some resources that are related to programming and
design.

These are particularily well-suited for use as console fonts, being a
lovechild of traditional monospaced programming fonts and iconic fonts
means you can both use them for programming work as well as to disply
fontawesome icons as outputs in scripts or you can use the powerline
glyphs to aesthetically spice up your `vim`.

# Tools

In this section I will showcase the most useful tools that I have an use. These
include both command-line and GUI tools. I'm a big proponent for doing things
the command-line way, but there are some things here and there that GUIs are
just better at.

## GUI

#### Dash: [`kapeli.com/dash`](https://kapeli.com/dash)

> An API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets
> of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 200+ APIs, 
> 100+ cheat sheets and more. You can even generate your own docsets or request

I literally don't know what I would do without Dash. If you need to find out
the name of a method of a function in a given programming language, if you
need to find out how a given library function works, or for some languages
even if you want to look up the source code of a particular function, Dash
is there for you. No more googling anything, you just download the docsets
for all the languages (and libraries, and Ruby gems, and Npm packages, 
and whatever else you need) and you alwasy have it with you.

My favourite (and only) GUI IRC client on macOS. It's really beautiful, it just
works, it's not overloaded. Also, it's open source — on the website you won't
find it directly, but the source is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Codeux-Software/Textual) and it is possible to
build it from source (if you know what you're doing).

#### GitUp: [`gitup.co`](http://gitup.co)

> Work quickly, safely, and without headaches.  The Git interface you've been
> missing all your life has finally arrived.

Normally, the `git` command-line tool is just what you need. It's more
efficient to use while you're in the terminal anyways, you don't want to
have to mess around with any buttons. But, there is just a handful of 
things that GitUp is really good at:

GitUp can visualize your repo so you know exactly what's going on, and
the great thing is that the visualization is real-time, meaning that it
updates while you mess with your repo.

I think this might just be the best feature of GitUp — it saves snapshots
of your repo before and after you do things, meaning that when you do
something stupid, you can always go back.

Basically any thing you can do with `git`, you can also do with GitUp.

I think as an open-source tool, GitUp is useful to have in your toolbelt.
It might not replace your everyday use of `git`, but it will be there when 
you need it.

#### Alacritty: [`github.com/jwilm/alacritty`](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)

Simple, performant, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator for macOS and Linux.
Probably the fastest terminal emulator out there.

I wrote this whole document in `vim` running inside `tmux` running in `Alacritty`.
Need I say more?

![Alacritty screenshot](img/alacritty.png)

## Basics

#### [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

Terminal multiplexer: run multiple virtual terminals in one physical
terminal. Want two terminals side-by-side? No problem. Want four terminals
in one? Easy. Want a large terminal to edit a file and a smaller underneath
to run tests? Done.

#### [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org)

Powerful shell with scripting language.

##### Plugins

  managing your ZSH configuration.
- [Zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw): Zsh configuration framework with
  blazing speed and modular extensions.

#### [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

The standard shell on most systems. Very simple but decent. This probably comes
pre-installed on your system anyways but hey — sent it some love.

##### Plugins

- [Sensible Bash](https://github.com/mrzool/bash-sensible): Sane bash defaults.

#### [Vim](http://www.vim.org)

> The ubiquitous editor.

Famously difficult to quit out of.

##### Plugins

- [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

  Makes it super easy to install plugins and runtime files into their own
  private directories. Why? Because it means that you can clone Vim plugins
  into `~/.vim/bundle` and they will be autoloaded.

# Languages

Which programming languages do I find cool? Which programming languages do I
find useful? Which programming languages would I recommend to a friend to learn?

## Ruby: [`ruby-lang.org`](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

> Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz”
> Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel,
> Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming
> with imperative programming.
>
> He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a
> way that mirrors life.  Building on this, he adds: Ruby is simple in
> appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body.

By far my favourite language. The syntax is very expressive, the standard
library is really good and the package manager,
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) is fantastic.

It is very easy to install packages, called *gems* in Ruby teminology:

    $ gem install bcrypt

And in addition to that, Ruby itself is very nice to use. 

```ruby
5.times do
  puts ["Hello", "world!"].join(' ')
end
```

### Tools

#### [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

> A Ruby static code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide.

It is easily installed with RubyGems:

```bash
$ gem install rubocop
```

With a valid ruby file, like such:

###### file: [`examples/rubocop/example.rb`](examples/rubocop/example.rb)

```ruby
# bad -- four spaces instead of two.
def bad_method
    puts "hello!"
end

# bad -- uses semicolon to separate expressions.
bad_method; bad_method

# bad -- no whitespace between operator.
sum = 1+3

# bad -- don't use several empty lines in a row.


puts(sum)
```

Running `rubycop` on it produces a set of warnings (`--format simple` reduces the
verbosity of the output):

```bash
$ rubocop --format simple examples/rubocop/example.rb
== examples/rubocop/example.rb ==
C:  3:  1: Layout/IndentationWidth: Use 2 (not 4) spaces for indentation.
C:  3: 10: Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
C:  7: 11: Style/Semicolon: Do not use semicolons to terminate expressions.
C: 10:  8: Layout/SpaceAroundOperators: Surrounding space missing for operator +.
C: 14:  1: Layout/EmptyLines: Extra blank line detected.

1 file inspected, 5 offenses detected
```

Some, but not all issues can be corrected automatically. To tell rubocop to try
to fix things, use the `-a` option, like so:

```bash
$ rubocop --format simple -a examples/rubocop/example.rb
== examples/rubocop/example.rb ==
C:  3:  1: [Corrected] Layout/IndentationWidth: Use 2 (not 4) spaces for indentation.
C:  3: 10: [Corrected] Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
C:  7: 11: Style/Semicolon: Do not use semicolons to terminate expressions.
C: 10:  8: [Corrected] Layout/SpaceAroundOperators: Surrounding space missing for operator +.
C: 14:  1: [Corrected] Layout/EmptyLines: Extra blank line detected.

1 file inspected, 5 offenses detected, 4 offenses corrected
```

### Libraries

## Crystal: [`crystal-lang.org`](https://crystal-lang.org/)

> Crystal is a programming language with the following goals:
> - Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
> - Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables
>   or method arguments.
> - Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
> - Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate
>   code.
> - Compile to efficient native code.

Basically, Crystal is like an improved (in terms of performance) version of
Ruby. It is statically typed — but thanks to type inference, you don't have
to specify types. There are some other differences, since it is a compiled
language it's not possible to evaluate code at runtime, but in exchange
the speed is on-par with C.

The [shards](https://crystalshards.xyz) package manager is very useful
because it is decentralized and allows to install dependencies from any
git repository.

```crystal
# A very basic HTTP server
require "http/server"

server = HTTP::Server.new(8080) do |context|
  context.response.content_type = "text/plain"
  context.response.print "Hello world, got #{context.request.path}!"
end

puts "Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080"
server.listen
```

### Tools

### Libraries

## C

> C (/siː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer
> programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable
> scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended
> operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical
> machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications
> that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating
> systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from
> supercomputers to embedded systems. *Source:
> [`wikipedia.org`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))*

C is a little bit of an oddball: It doesn't really have a website that I
could link to. But I guess that's okay, I mean basically everyone knows it.

What is awesome about it, you ask? The fact that it is still alive. It might
not be the nicest of all languages. In fact, when categorizing it, it is
easiest to list the things that it doesn't have. Without a package manager,
building code is usually done with an embarassingly fragile set of scripts that
are prone to failure when run on an unfamiliar platform. Without namespacing,
most libraries prefix all functions and macros with the name of the library.
Without memory safety, we need all kinds of tools, sanitizers, fuzzers and
checkers to test if programs leak and behave, and even with these tools bugs
and security issues are common. But despite all of that, C is still the most
important language. Not because it is pretty, but because it is one of the most
basic building blocks, with most languages implemented in C. Knowing C is
paramount when trying to understand other languages by digging into their
source code.

### Libraries

#### Snow: [`github.com/mortie/snow`](https://github.com/mortie/snow)

> Header-only unit testing library for C.

C really doesn't have a lot built-in. As far as testing goes, the only
tool that C provides is the `assert()` macro, which can be used to
set run-time assertions, which will abort the program when false.

Snow wraps this into a nice-to-use DSL for defining tests for different
modules and pretty-prints the test invocation.

###### Example

This is what a sample test with snow could look like (adapted from the
[snow GitHub readme](https://github.com/mortie/snow/blob/master/README.md)):

```c
describe(files, {
  it("opens files", {
    FILE *f = fopen("test", "r");
    assertneq(f, NULL);
    defer(fclose(f));
  });

  subdesc(fread, {
    it("reads 10 bytes", {
      FILE *f = fopen("/dev/zero", "r");
      assertneq(f, NULL);
      defer(fclose(f));

      char buf[10];
      asserteq(fread(buf, 1, 10, f), 10);
    });
  });
});

snow_main();
```

## Rust: [`rust-lang.org`](https://rust-lang.org)

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents

We all have a joke or two about a hipster programmer wildly fighting the
Rust borrow checker. It's a beautiful language, with a very intimidating
promise and the potential to rival C. It does have a sweet syntax, taking
in many inspirations from other languages.

### Tools

#### [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt)

>   A tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines.

#### [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs)

> Installer for Rust.

This description is actually a bit underwhelming, since `rustup` does a little
more than just installing Rust. It can keep track of different toolchains for,
you can use it to switch between channels (eg. `stable`, `beta`, `nightly`),
and you can update each toolchain.
