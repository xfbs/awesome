## Entertainment

### Journals

Semi-regular publications. As the publication frequency is much lower than
news websites, these can go into much more detail and are thus probably the
best way to s

#### PoC||GTFO: [`alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo`](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/)

> The international journal of *Proof of Concept or Get The Fuck Out*.

Contains a healthy mixture of humorous and very in-depth technical articles of
how to hack, with a focus on retro hardware and mind-boggling file format
hackery.

### News

As François put it:

> “Tell me what you read and I'll tell you who you are" is true enough, but
> I'd know you better if you told me what you reread.”

These are news sites worth reading and hopefully re-reading, about technology
and related topics.

#### Lobsters: [`lobste.rs`](https://lobste.rs/), ★★★★★

> Technology-focused community centered around link aggregation and discussion.

All links are user-submitted. Small friendly community. Invite-only and ad free.

#### Hacker News: [`news.ycombinator.com`](https://news.ycombinator.com/), ★★★★☆

> Social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship.

Run by startup fund Y Combinator. User-submitten link aggregator, bigger community,
less personal but also ad-free.

#### The Register: [`theregister.co.uk`](http://www.theregister.co.uk/), ★★★★☆

> Independent news and views for the tech community.

Based in London, UK. Does some really good dry humor, as you would expect.

#### Ars Technica: [`arstechnica.com`](https://arstechnica.com/), ★★★★☆

<!-- TODO: description -->
News, guides, reviews, and features.

#### Hubski: [`hubski.com`](http://hubski.com), ★★★★☆

News from silicon valley.

### Blogs

A few technology/culture centric blogs woth checking out.

#### /dev/lawyer: [`writing.kemitchell.com`](https://writing.kemitchell.com)

> *Law, technology, and the space between*.

#### Julia Evans: [`jvns.ca`](https://jvns.ca)

> Regular writings involving Rust, Ruby and how to take things like syscalls
> apart.

#### Eli Bendersky's Website: [`eli.thegreenplace.net`](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/)

#### Xiph Videos [`xiph.org/video`](https://www.xiph.org/video/), ★★★★★

> *[Mini-] series of self-produced videos to spread techie-level knowledge about digital media*.

This two-part series, consisting of *A Digital Media Primer for Geeks* and
*Digital Show & Tell*, you can learn about the interface between analog and digital:
how are analog singals captured? How are they reproduced? What kinds of analog signals
can we capture? What does the sampling frequency have to do with this? What is the
Nyquist frequency? Why does it still make sense to use sampling rates much higher than
the audible spectrum to capture analog signals accurately?

### CCC Media: [`media.ccc.de`](https://media.ccc.de), ★★★★★

> Offers a wide variety of video and audio material distributed by the Chaos
> Computer Club provided in native formats (usually MPEG and/or Vorbis families)
> for online viewing. Older, archived recordings might require proprietary
> players. The media files on this site can also be downloaded for offline consumption.

Streams recordings (of talks) from events by the CCC, Europe's largest association
of hackers. Has a lot of high-quality content.

## Resources

You want to learn something? You've come to the right place.

#### Math ∩ Programming: [`jeremykun.com`](https://jeremykun.com)

Has two sections, which are of equally high quality: the 
[Primers](https://jeremykun.com/primers/), which are a terse explanation of
mathematical concepts that are used or useful in computer science.
Is there a topic in mathematics that you don't quite understand or you
want to refresh, but you don't want to read an 800-page mathematics
textbook? Then this section is for you. 

The other section is the [Main Content](https://jeremykun.com/main-content/),
which assumes that you are familiar with all the topics mentioned in the
[Primers](https://jeremykun.com/primers/).

#### [What every computer science major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/)

Has a very nice overview of the field of computer science, along
with very helpful literature for most parts of it, and what is
expected of a computer scientist to know of each of the parts.

#### [Programming Language Theory](http://steshaw.org/plt/)

> Finding a path to enlightenment in Programming Language Theory can
> be a tough one, particularly for programming practitioners who didn’t
> learn it at school. This resource is here to help. 

Provides a listing of resources to help deepen one's understanding
of PLT.

#### [Seeing Theory](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/)

> A visual introduction to probability and statistics.

Want to refresh your knowledge of probability and statistics, but
prefer not to wade through dry textbooks? Then this page is for you.

## Challenges

So you think you can code? Well, prove yourself wrong with any one of these
challenges. Choose from math, crypto or coding-themed puzzles.

### Math

#### Project Euler: [`projecteuler.net`](https://projecteuler.net/), ★★★★★

> A series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems
> that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
> Provides a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar
> areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Great place for beginners and more advanced people alike, whether
you are interested in learning or improving your programming skills
or in mathematics.

### Crypto

#### matasano: [`cryptopals.com`](http://cryptopals.com), ★★★★★

> A different way to learn about crypto than taking a class
> or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived
> from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic
> constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying
> crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have
> learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also
> understand how they're attacked.

Great place for some hands-on experience with cryptography, the
challenges aren't too difficult but they provide a good understanding
of the theory behind some of the crypto we use.

#### id0-rsa: [`id0-rsa.pub`](https://id0-rsa.pub),

> Some problems related to computer security (specifically poorly
> implemented security). You are free to use any language
> and environment you like to complete them. The problems require
> familiarity with programming, but not necessarily with applied
> cryptography or computer security in general.

### Coding 

#### CS:APP3e Lab Assignments: [`csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html`](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html)

> This book (CS:APP3e) is the third edition of a book that stems from the
> introductory computer systems course we developed at Carnegie Mellon
> University, starting in the Fall of 1998, called "Introduction to Computer
> Systems" (ICS)

Assignments involving low-level programming, some of them are quite interesting.

#### CodeChef: [`codechef.com`](https://www.codechef.com)

> CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the
> world of algorithms, computer programming and programming contests. We host
> three featured contests every month and give away prizes and goodies to the
> winners as encouragement. Apart from this, the platform is open to the entire
> programming community to host their own contests. Major institutions and
> organizations across the globe use our platform to host their contests. On an
> average, 30+ external contests are hosted on our platform every month.

### Commercial

There are also some commecial challenges. These websites might offer paid
subscriptions or they might be sponsored by companies and used as recruitment
tools. They still have interesting problems — but some people use these as a
means to get hired instead of out of the pure pleasure of solving a
(complicated) problem.

#### HackerRank: [`hackerrank.com`](https://www.hackerrank.com)

> The HackerRank team is on a mission to match every developer in the world to
> the right job by providing a technical recruiting platform that assesses
> developers based on actual coding skills. Our solution is revolutionizing the
> way companies discover and evaluate talented developers. HackerRank is the
> destination for the best developers to hone their skills and for companies to
> find top software developers.

#### LeetCode: [`leetcode.com`](https://leetcode.com)

> Over 750 questions for you to practice. Come and join one of the largest tech
> communities with hundreds of thousands of active users and participate in our
> contests to challenge yourself and earn rewards.

### Fun

There are also some challenges that are a little more game-like. Some of these
might be good for beginners, while others might be good because you can watch
your code running, live.

#### RubyWarrior: [`bloc.io/ruby-warrior`](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior)

> A TRIUMPHANT QUEST OF ADVENTURE, LOVE & DESTINY 
> ALL WITHIN A FEW LINES OF CODE

You take control over a warrior, by writing a minimalist A.I. to control
him on his quest.

#### Screeps: [`screeps.com`](https://screeps.com)

> Screeps means “scripting creeps.” It’s an open-source sandbox MMO RTS game
> for programmers, wherein the core mechanic is programming your units’ AI. You
> control your colony by writing JavaScript which operate 24/7 in the single
> persistent real-time world filled by other players on par with you.

### Resources

You need help with some of these challenges? Or you want to learn
more? These resources might help.

#### Competetive Programmer's Handbook: [`cses.fi/book.html`](https://cses.fi/book.html)

> The purpose of this book is to give the reader a thorough introduction to
> competitive programming. The book is especially intended for students who
> want to learn algorithms and possibly participate in the International
> Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) or in the International Collegiate Programming
> Contest (ICPC).

## Design

Programming and Design is inseparably linked — whenever you write code, you design.
That could be the design of the framework, the design of the API, or the
design of the UI. These are some resources that are related to programming and
design.

### Photography

#### Unsplash: [`unsplash.com`](https://unsplash.com), ★★★★★

> Over 300,000 free (do whatever you want) high-resolution photos brought
> to you by the world’s most generous community of photographers.

Need a new wallpaper? A backgroup photo for a website design? Stock photos
to fill in some blanks?

### Fonts

#### nerd-fonts: [`github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts`](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

> Project that patches developer targeted fonts with a high number of glyphs
> (icons). Specifically to add a high number of extra glyphs from popular 'iconic
> fonts' such as Font Awesome ➶, Devicons ➶, Octicons ➶, and others.

These are particularily well-suited for use as console fonts, being a
lovechild of traditional monospaced programming fonts and iconic fonts
means you can both use them for programming work as well as to disply
fontawesome icons as outputs in scripts or you can use the powerline
glyphs to aesthetically spice up your `vim`.

#### Input: [`input.fontbureau.com`](http://input.fontbureau.com)

> Flexible system of fonts designed specifically for code by David Jonathan
> Ross. It offers both monospaced and proportional fonts, all with a large
> range of widths, weights, and styles for richer code formatting.

A particularly beautiful set of monospace fonts for programming.

## Programming Languages

Which programming languages do I find cool? Which programming languages do I
find useful? Which programming languages would I recommend to a friend to learn?

>   Not exactly the next big thing anymore, but still my go-to programming
>   language for it's sweet syntax. Interpreted, dynamically-typed. Bonus:
>   amazing package manager *rubygems*.

  - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

>   Statically-typed, compiled Ruby lookalike, with a speed comparable to C
>   thanks to it's LLVM backbone. Bonus: has a package manager, *shard*.

  - [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)

>   It just won't ever die. The grandfather of programming languages, a
>   necessary evil but also an addictive one. With a modern compiler and when
>   using the new C11 standard it's a little better.

  - [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

>   Statically typed, memory-safe compiled language rivalling some of C's
>   territory. Notoriously mean compiler, but fast iterations and an awesome
>   integrated package manager, *cargo* make the programmer happy.

  - [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)

>   What can I say? Everybody's Favourite Language (tm).

  - [Python](https://python.org)

<!--
  - [chez scheme](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme), because I never really
    worked with a scheme before and it's reportedly very fast. **Edit**: I might
    use a different flavour of Scheme, [chicken scheme](http://call-cc.org),
    because it seems a little more simplistic and doesn't have the overhead of
    an interpreter since it's compiled (although, it might be slower than
    `chez`).
  - [ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) because I keep hearing about it in
    unexpected places and it got me curious.
  - [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) because all the cool kids are doing
    it and my javascript is quite rusty.
  - [java9](https://www.oracle.com/java/java9.html) because that's what most
    people worldwide speak and while I'm really not a fan of java, they did add
    some features that make it interesting.
  - [haskell](https://www.haskell.org), because it's just been on my to do list
    for too long.
  - [risc5asm](https://rv8.io), because well you need to have done some assembly
    to be able to call yourself a 'real' programmer, and x86 assembler is too
    ordinaire for me and MIPS stopped being interesting 20 years ago.
  - [cpp](http://clang.org), because I haven't really gotten around to playing
    with C++14 and it could be okay.
  - [swift](https://github.com/apple/swift), because it's seems cool even though
    it's from a major company and not some academic tech hippies. it might even
    be useful..
  - [nim](https://nim-lang.org), because compiling to C, it has the potential to
    be rather quick but with a larger standard library, and with a python-esque
    syntax, also quite usable.
  - [luajit](https://luajit.org/luajit.html), because I'm already familiar with
    lua and it claims to be the 'fastest dynamic language'.
  - [dlang](https://dlang.org/), because I've always been interested by it.
-->

## Tools

>   The master is only as good as the tools he uses.

In this section I will showcase the most useful tools that I have an use. These
include both command-line and GUI tools. I'm a big proponent for doing things
the command-line way, but there are some things here and there that GUIs are
just better at.

### Documentation Browsers

#### Dash: [`kapeli.com/dash`](https://kapeli.com/dash)

> An API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets
> of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 200+ APIs, 
> 100+ cheat sheets and more. You can even generate your own docsets or request
> docsets to be included.

I literally don't know what I would do without Dash. If you need to find out
the name of a method of a function in a given programming language, if you
need to find out how a given library function works, or for some languages
even if you want to look up the source code of a particular function, Dash
is there for you. No more googling anything, you just download the docsets
for all the languages (and libraries, and Ruby gems, and Npm packages, 
and whatever else you need) and you alwasy have it with you.

### Terminal

The most powerful tool for the programmer is the terminal.

>   A curated list of Terminal frameworks, plugins & resources for CLI lovers.

- [Terminals Are Sexy](https://terminalsare.sexy)

#### Emulators

>   Simple, performant, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator for macOS and Linux.
>   Probably the fastest terminal emulator out there.

- [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty)

>   Terminal multiplexer: run multiple virtual terminals in one physical
>   terminal. Open terminal side-by-side.

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

#### Shells

>   Powerful shell with scripting language.

- [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org)

>   Open source, community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration.

- [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh)

>   Zsh configuration framework with blazing speed and modular extensions.

- [Zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw)

>   The standard shell on most systems. Very simple but decent. 

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

>   Sane bash defaults.

- [Sensible Bash](https://github.com/mrzool/bash-sensible)

### Editors

What is a programmer without a capable editor?

>   The ubiquitous editor. Available on most systems out-of-the-box. Versatile.
>   Extendable with plugins. Famously difficult to quit out of.

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org)

>   Modern editor based on Vim, with better extendability support.

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io)

>   No plugins, zero configurations. All the essentials packed in by default.
>   Writtenin Rust, inspired by Vim.

- [AMP](https://amp.rs)

#### Editor Plugins

No editor is complete without a decent set of plugins to enable all the
functionality you need.

>   Makes it super easy to install plugins and runtime files into their own
>   private directories. Why? Because it means that you can clone Vim plugins
>   into `~/.vim/bundle` and they will be autoloaded.

- [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

>   Sensible defaults for Vim.

- [sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)

>   Syntax checker for Vim.

- [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)

>   File explorar plugin for Vim.

- [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)

>   Solarized colorscheme for Vim.

- [vim-colors-solatized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)

>   Lean and mean status / tabline for Vim that's light as air.

- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

### Version Control

Version Control is to programming as insurance is to driving your car: you might
not like it at first, but after you've experienced one or another situtation,
you'll be happy to have it.

>   The one and only; the true path to programmer satisfaction.

- [git](https://git-scm.com)

### Static Analysis

It can catch bugs — before they happen!

>   A Ruby static code analyzer, based on the community Ruby style guide. Some
>   of the violations it finds it can, if you want it to, fix itself.

- [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

>   A clang-based C++ “linter” tool. Its purpose is to provide an extensible
>   framework for diagnosing and fixing typical programming errors, like style
>   violations, interface misuse, or bugs that can be deduced via static
>   analysis.

- [clang-tidy](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)

>   A set of tools and APIs to perform static analysis, code visualizations,
>   code navigations, or style-preserving source-to-source transformations such
>   as refactorings on source code. There is good support for C, Java,
>   Javascript and PHP. There is also preliminary support for other languages
>   such as C++, Rust, C#, Html, CSS, Erlang, Lisp, Haskell, Python, OPA and
>   SQL. There is also very good support for OCaml code so that the framework
>   can be used on the code of pfff itself.

- [pfff](https://github.com/facebook/pfff)

### Code Formatter

While some programming languages come with tooling out-of-the-box, such as
Crystal with it's `crystal tool format` code formatter, others have to rely on
external formatters. These are some that I found useful.

>   A tool to format C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf code.

- [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)

>   A tool for formatting Rust code according to style guidelines.

- [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt)

### Code Sanitizers

While we can't prevent bugs from occuring in the first place, there are some
things we can do in advance to help catch some.

>   A fast memory error detector, that can find out-of-bounds accesses, 
>   use-after-free, double-free, invalid free, memory leaks.

- [AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html)

>   A run-time memory leak detector.

- [LeakSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html)

>   A detector of uninitialized reads.

- [MemorySanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html)

>   A fast undefined behavior detector. Modifies the program at compile-time
>   to catch various kinds of undefined behavior during program execution, for
>   example: using misaligned or null pointers, signed integer overflows, or
>   conversion to, from, or between floating-point types which would overflow
>   the destination.

- [UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)

>   An instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. Includes
>   tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading
>   bugs, and profile code in detail.

- [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org)

### Debuggers

Knowing the ins and outs of your favourite debugger is the key to efficient and
frustrationless programming in lower-level languages.

>   The debugger we all know, love and hate.

- [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)

>   A *next generation, high-performance* debugger.

- [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org)

>   Record a failure once, then debug the recording, deterministically, as many
>   times as you want.

- [rr](http://rr-project.org)

## Libraries

What good is a programming language without the proper libraries to get anything
done?

### C Libraries

>   Parse and generate JSON formatted data.

- [Jansson](https://github.com/akheron/jansson)

>   Debug like a sir.

- [Debug](https://github.com/esneider/debug)

>   UTF-8 string handling made easy.

- [utf8.h](https://github.com/sheredom/utf8.h)

>   Regex library, default library used by Ruby 2.0 and later.
